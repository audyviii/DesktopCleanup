# DesktopCleanup
A small project to automate cleaning up files and sorting them to specific folders.

This is a small project that was intended to help automate a task of maintaining my Downloads folder-- that later included Desktop.
Initially this was just a program you click on and everything simutaneously disappears. Which, later in time, became a very simple GUI
through Tkinter library.

This is a project/plan to build this out to daily use.
